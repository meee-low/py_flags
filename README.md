# CLI flags module for python

An interesting API for handling command line arguments/flags in python.

Inspired by the Go module [flag](https://pkg.go.dev/flag) and [Tsoding's flag.h for C](https://github.com/tsoding/flag.h).


Work in progress, everything is subject to change.

Feel free to use it without credit (just don't claim it as yours).
